    <h2>What is Theravada Buddhism?</h2>
    <p>The Theravada tradition is largely considered to be the "truest" form of Buddhism. Unlike the Mahayana traditions, the Theravadans take a more psychological and philosophical (as opposed to religious) approach to achieving liberation.</p>

    <h3>Common to Both Schools</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Siddhartha Gautama was the first human Buddha</li>
      <li>Meditation is the staple of skillful practice</li>
      <li>The Nobe Eightfold Path is the way to unshakeable liberation of mind</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For a similar site click <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/schools1.htm"><strong>here.</strong></a> This site is a bit lacking in style, and it uses the table element to contain the bulk of its main content, which seems superfluous to me. All of its styling is written in html instead of CSS which seems to make it a bit primitive.</p>
